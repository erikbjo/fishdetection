# Computer Vision - Assignment 2

This repository contains materials for Assignment 2 of Computer Vision Course.

## Part One: Project Work

In this part of the project, our primary goal is to reveal and document our progress including the intermediate results we've achieved during the development of our Computer Vision model.

### 1. Data Preparation

Of significant importance is how the data has been prepared. This process is essential as it affects the performance of our model. This section will outline how our data was prepared for this project.

### 2. Pre-processing Steps

This crucial step involves transforming raw data into an understandable format. Real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and lacking in certain behaviours or trends, and is likely to contain many errors. Data preprocessing is a proven method of resolving such issues.

### 3. Results So Far

This section documents the results obtained so far in the project. We believe openness about both successful and unsuccessful trials fosters a better understanding of the process and promotes a more realistic view of the project.

#### Successful Attempts

Here, we outline the procedures and strategies that have yielded positive results in the project's execution.

#### Failed Attempts

Despite best efforts, not all attempts were successful. Here, we discuss our failed attempts, the factors contributing to these failures, and the lessons learned from them.

For each unsuccessful attempt, we include detailed reasoning for why it didn't work. Understanding the reasons behind these failed attempts is key to refining our approach and enhancing our chances of success in future endeavors.

Stay tuned for updates on our project journey.
